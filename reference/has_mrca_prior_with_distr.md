# See if the inference model has one MRCA prior with a distribution

See if the inference model has one MRCA prior with a distribution

## Usage

``` r
has_mrca_prior_with_distr(inference_model)
```

## Arguments

- inference_model:

  a Bayesian phylogenetic inference model. An inference model is the
  complete model setup in which a site model, clock model, tree prior
  and more are specified. Use
  [create_inference_model](https://docs.ropensci.org/beautier/reference/create_inference_model.md)
  to create an inference model. Use
  [check_inference_model](https://docs.ropensci.org/beautier/reference/check_inference_model.md)
  to check if an inference model is valid. Use
  [rename_inference_model_filenames](https://docs.ropensci.org/beautier/reference/rename_inference_model_filenames.md)
  to rename the files in an inference model.

## Value

TRUE if the inference model has one MRCA prior with a distribution,
FALSE otherwise
